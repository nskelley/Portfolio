# [ECON 320 - Econometrics R Lab Final Project](/ECON320_Econometrics_Lab/01_320_Final_Project.rmd)

This project was the final assignment from my Econometrics R lab. We were asked to find a data set, produce summary statistics and visualizations, and perform regression analyses in an Rmarkdown report. I used the *DW-NOMINATE* data from [Voteview](https://www.voteview.com/), a measure of the political ideologies of members of Congress and presidents. My analysis examined the regional differences in political ideology and ideological purity and the changes in polarization over time and by political party.
