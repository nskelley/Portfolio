# ECON 385 - Causal Inference

This folder contains Rmarkdown documents used to generate reports replicating the results of published economic research using the publicly available data sets. 

## [Regression Discontinuity](/ECON385_Causal_Inference/01_Regression_Discontinuity.rmd)

In this assignment, I used the data from Lee (2008) to replicate some of the tables and figures used in the paper. Lee (2008) exploits the discontinuity around the threshold of victory for candidates in an election to evaluate the effect of incumbency on election outcomes.

## [Differences in Differences](/ECON385_Causal_Inference/02_DiffInDiff.rmd)

Eissa & Liebman (1996) use a differences-in-differences design to study the effect of the Earned Income Tax Credit on labor supply for single mothers and single non-mothers. In this assignment, I replicate tables and figures from Eissa & Liebman (1996), including heterogeneity analysis and falsification tests.

## [Randomized Controlled Trial](/ECON385_Causal_Inference/03_RCT.rmd)

This assignment uses data from Martinez et al. (2018), who studied the effects of micro-entrepreneurship programs by randomly assigning participants to receive training and studying the effects for almost four years. Using the data from Martinez et al. (2018), I replicate the results reported by Martinez et al. (2019), including summary statistics, t-tests, and regression models.
