# Portfolio

Welcome to my coding portfolio! Here you can explore some of my recent work in R, including projects from Emory coursework and research.

## [Summer Undergraduate Research Experience (SURE)](/SURE_Social_Program_Manipulation)
*Emory University, Summer 2021*

This folder contains code I wrote during the Summer of 2021 as part of the Summer Undergraduate Research Experience (SURE) program at Emory University. Code includes that used for analysis and for producing tables and graphs. One data source referenced in the code is the [Vulnerability Assessment for Syrian Refugees in Lebanon (VASyR)](http://ialebanon.unhcr.org/vasyr/) from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refguees.

Due to the confidential nature of the data and results, the files contained in this folder are not exhaustive and may have been edited to remove sensitive information. For the same reason, I also do not provide any of the tables and graphics produced by the included code.

## [ECON 385: Special Topics in Economics - Causal Inference](/ECON385_Causal_Inference)
*Emory University, Spring 2020*

This folder contains Rmarkdown documents used to generate reports replicating the results of published economic research using the publicly available data sets. These reports were part of class assignments intended to teach us how to apply the causal methods we were learning about (namely, randomized controlled trials, regression discontinuity, differences-in-differences, and instrumental variables) in R.

If you'd prefer to view the output HTML files as webpages, you can use one of the following links to pages on my website:

* [Regression Discontinuity](https://www.nicholasskelley.com/rmd/causal-replications/Skelley_ECON385_RDD.html)

* [Differences-in-Differences](https://www.nicholasskelley.com/rmd/causal-replications/Skelley_ECON385_DiffInDiff.html)

* [Randomized Controlled Trial](https://www.nicholasskelley.com/rmd/causal-replications/Skelley_ECON385_RCT.html)

## [ECON 320: Econometrics - R Lab](/ECON320_Econometrics_Lab)
*Emory University, Spring 2020*

The final project in the Econemetrics coding lab was to find a data set and generate a report in Rmarkdown containing summary statistics, visualizations, regression models, and analyses of the results. I elected to use the [DW-NOMINATE data set from Voteview](https://www.voteview.com/data) for my report and examine political ideology by region and political polarization trends over time.

This folder contains the raw Rmarkdown file used to generate the report. If you would rather see the HTML output of the report on my website, [you can click here](https://www.nicholasskelley.com/rmd/Skelley_ECON320_Project.html).
